# MyReads Project

This is the completed MyReads project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The starter template was provided by Udacity who provided a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that was used, but without any of the React code that was needed to complete the project. I have added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template.

## Application

To access the web app

* download the zip file or clone the project
* install the project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Thank you!
